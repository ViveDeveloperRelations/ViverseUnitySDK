==prerequisites
unity 6 - tested with 6000.0.34f1, but any unity 6 LTS should work
-unity 6 webgl plugin for unity installed for that version of unity

windows instructions

Create a hosts file entry for create.viverse.com in your hosts file to enable running a local server 'on the same domain' as viverse servers
go to
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
edit the file "hosts", add the line

127.0.0.1 create.viverse.com

-install mkcert globally, make sure it's on the default path by running 'mkcert -version' on a new terminal instance
if you just added it to your path, you may need to reboot for unity to be able to access this tool

    https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#windows

    test by running 'mkcert -version' on the command line

- ensure that no other https server is running by going to https://localhost and ensuring that you see a response indicating that the site cannot be reached


==project setup


create new unity project / open new one
import package tgz
import samples for testing purposes


===set up configuration

switch to webgl platform
open menu item "tools/webgl" settings window


---DO NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW :: if you want to render viverse avatars, select import packages
	KNOWN ISSUE-- likely solved on monday
	currently after a bit, you'll have to close unity project and re-open it, it looks like it can get stuck in an import loop

import packages in package manager (this will be part of the menu above, but there's some edge case i need to sort out):
https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM.git?path=/Assets/UniGLTF#v0.128.2
https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM.git?path=/Assets/VRM#v0.128.2
https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM.git?path=/Assets/VRM10#v0.128.2


select 'apply all settings' to get base settings correct on your build, set up the correct preloaded shaders to be able to render avatas correctly


add configurable driver sample scene to the build settings 
build output to a folder that is parallel to the Assets folder called "Build"
\PROJECT_ROOT_FOLDER
    \Assets
    \Build  <--build the project to a new folder named "Build"
    \Library
    \...



go back to tools/webgl settings
go to bottom of tab and select run http server

for leaderboards, set up an account and application on 
https://developer.viveport.com/console/titles

go to the VIVEPORT listing and copy the VIVEPORT ID for your leaderboard application id
go to leaderboard tab under VIVEPORT SDK to set up a leaderboard name
https://developer.vive.com/resources/viveport/sdk/documentation/english/viveport-sdk/apis/leaderboards-api/configuring-leaderboards-viveport/






--There may be CORS errors in the log for leaderboard requests at this at the moment due to headers not being sent with the response from www.viverse.com, but the request succeeds regardless so those errors in the console can be ignored


urp hair may be failing for my avatar
